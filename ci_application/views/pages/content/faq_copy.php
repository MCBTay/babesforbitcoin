			<h2>About Bitcoin</h2>
			<div class="accordion" id="about-bitcoin">
				<h3>What is Bitcoin?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Bitcoin is a virtual currency which is much safer to use than the current credit systems society uses today. It was born on the net and exists on the net, much in the same way you rarely actually hold any of the money you spend already.</p>
					<p>Check out this video to see how it all works!</p>
					<p><iframe width="489" height="275" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Gc2en3nHxA4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
				</div>
				<h3>Where can I purchase Bitcoin?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>You can purchase Bitcoin from many places, you could use a purchasing website such as Coinbase (<a href="http://www.coinbase.com" target="_blank">www.coinbase.com</a>) which we use and highly recommend.  Alternatively, you could buy bitcoin on any cryptocurrency exchange, or even from regular everyday people.</p>
					<p>While it is easy to find many places to buy Bitcoin, there are many scams out there. If you see a new place to buy bitcoin that you are curious about, you are welcome to contact us (contact link) or visit our favorite community at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin" target="_blank">www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin</a>.</p>
				</div>
				<h3 id="accordion1">How can I turn Bitcoin into USD?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>There are many options for turning your BTC into USD.  We allow on-site conversions of your in wallet bitcoin, however only models will be able to withdraw this as cash.  If you wish to sell your bitcoin elsewhere, Coinbase (<a href="http://www.coinbase.com" target="_blank">www.coinbase.com</a>) as well as other Bitcoin exchanges will allow you to cash in on your investment.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>How do I mine Bitcoin?</h3>
				<div>
					<p><a href="http://startbitcoin.com/" target="_blank">http://startbitcoin.com/</a></p>
					<p>If you do plan on joining a mining pool, we recommend P2Pool (<a href="http://www.p2pool.org/" target="_blank">http://www.p2pool.org/</a>), this pool aims to keep bitcoin decentralized in order to prevent 51% attacks.</p>
					<p>GHash.IO (<a href="https://ghash.io/" target="_blank">https://ghash.io/</a>) is common as well, however it often has a high hashrate and I recommend going with another pool to prevent the possibility of any problematic attacks.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>What are 51% attacks?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>You can read about a 51% attack here (<a href="http://learncryptography.com/51-attack/" target="_blank">http://learncryptography.com/51-attack/</a>) however to sum it up; it could give the controlling user the power to create counterfeit Bitcoins, which could ruin the value of Bitcoin.  Alternatively, if someone finds the Bitcoins you have purchased were counterfeited, your personal purchase would be lost.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Where can I download my own wallet?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>We recommend the official bitcoin website in order to help you choose a personal wallet, you can find that <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Anything else?</h3>
				<div>

			<h2>For the guys</h2>
			<div class="accordion">
				<h3>Are the girls real?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Absolutely, every model will have to be approved individually by a moderator before they are even shown on the site, all models will upload a timestamped fansign to prove their validity.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Do I need to have a credit card?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Not at all, there are several methods of payment. Bitcoin - which can be mined (generated) by your computer directly only requires a free wallet to utilize and send. You may also link a bank account directly, or use one of our other methods which are coming very soon - which will allow you to earn funds without paying a dime!</p>

				<h3>What makes Babes for Bitcoin better than the rest?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>On BFB we strive to take much of the work of being an online model off of your shoulders, and make it easy for you to sell content in your offtime. This leaves you free time to either socialize with friends you make on the site, or let you live a free and fun life without having to be logged on to the web all hours of the day!</p>
					<p>Innovation: The owners of BFB are at the forefront of technology, we have big plans in the works and will have everything you wish you could get out of similar sites. This means ever updating features, mobile access, and more.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>How much can I make?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Babes for Bitcoin is the top when it comes to earnings, with the highest starting % rate for models ~ 70% per photoset/video.  You will earn more as you sell, up to a total possibility of 90%.  There is no cap on total commissions.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Why would I take Bitcoin as a form of payment?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>With Bitcoin, your payments are instant and you can withdraw your funds immediately. While the value of Bitcoins fluctuates frequently, it has risen a staggering amount.  In December of 2012 the value was only $13.  Currently the price is at $<?php echo number_format($this->cart_model->btc_to_usd(1), 2); ?> which means it can be a great investment!</p>
					<p>If you'd like to sell the bitcoins you receive please see the "<a id="how-can-i-turn-bitcoin-into-usd" href="javascript:void(0);">How can I turn Bitcoin into USD?</a>" entry under "About Bitcoin" on this FAQ.</p>
					<p>However you DO NOT have to take any bitcoin, you choose what currency you would like to receive. Members will be able to pay bitcoin and you will receive cash if you so choose.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Does it cost me anything?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Nope! You keep all of your commission, no monthly fees or anything of the sort!</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Am I allowed to share personal information?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>You are welcome to post your twitter, tumblr, vine, or any other social networking site on which you may promote your BFB profile as well as make closer connections with your contributors. </p>

				</div>
				<h3>What are the requirements as a model?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>The goal at BFB is to have the highest quality models, with an abundance of quality content.  You'll need to provide a valid ID showing you are over 18, and upload a profile photo.  After approval you'll be given 30 days to upload 1 photoset or video, and then you are a member for life! If you are unable to upload a photoset or video within that time, your profile will be hidden from public view until you are able to do so.</p>
